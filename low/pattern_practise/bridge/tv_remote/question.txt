ðŸ§  Scenario:
You are designing a universal Remote Control system that should work with multiple TV brands (e.g., Sony, Samsung, LG).
You want to keep the Remote (control interface) and the TV implementation (device behavior) decoupled,
so new TVs or new types of remotes can be added independently.
