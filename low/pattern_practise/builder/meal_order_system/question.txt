ðŸ§© Problem Statement: Meal Order Builder System
    ðŸ“œ Background:
            You're building a system for a smart food ordering kiosk (like in fast food chains). Each Meal consists of multiple customizable parts: Main Item, Side Item, Drink, and optionally Dessert or Sauces. Different types of meals (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg, Kids, Combo) may include different combinations of these parts.

            You are asked to design a flexible and maintainable system to build meal orders, step by step, based on user inputs or pre-defined presets.

    ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
            A Meal object should be created step-by-step (not all attributes are required).

            Support building:

            Custom Meals (user selects components)

            Predefined Meal Combos (e.g., Veg Combo, Kids Meal, Family Pack)

            Ensure the client doesn't directly construct the Meal object.

            Support future extensibility (e.g., add healthy options, calorie tracking, etc.)
