Definition
    The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.


When to Use
    When exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

    Examples:

        Logger

        Configuration manager

        Cache

        Thread pool

        Database connection manager

Key Concepts
    Private constructor

    Static instance of the class

    Static method to get the instance
