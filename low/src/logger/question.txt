1- ðŸ“Œ Multiple Sync: The framework should support logging in multiple places, such as console, log file, database, and distributed queue.
    Eg: CRITICAL should be redirected to console + log files
    Error should be redirected to console + log file
    Debug should be redirected to log file
    and more....

2- ðŸ“Œ Multiple Categories: The framework should support logging into multiple categories, such as info, debug, and error.
3- ðŸ“Œ Configurability: The category and logging location should be configurable.

1. low latency
2. high throughput
3. no log corruption and loss
4. consider pushing it to console - on live system
