## Definition:

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


## What It Means:
You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without changing its existing code.

This makes your system more maintainable and less prone to bugs when requirements change.


## Benefits:
- Easier to maintain
- Encourages clean separation of concerns
- Supports plug-and-play architecture
- No chances of regression
