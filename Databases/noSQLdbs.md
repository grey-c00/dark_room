NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are a category of databases designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility, scalability, and high performance â€” unlike traditional relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) which follow fixed schemas and ACID guarantees.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Characteristics of NoSQL Databases
Feature	Description
Schema-less	No fixed table structure â€” you can store different fields in different records.
Horizontally Scalable	Designed to scale out using commodity hardware, making them suitable for big data and distributed systems.
High Performance	Optimized for fast reads/writes, often by sacrificing strict consistency.
Flexible Data Models	Suitable for JSON, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.
Eventual Consistency	Most NoSQL DBs favor availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency (CAP theorem).
