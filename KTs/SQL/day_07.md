Today, we are going to learn around optimizations and best practices around a SQL table.

So far, we have done some basic operations on single SQL table such table creation, insertion, selection, deletion, table deleton etc.
Just FYI that each operation creats its own type of load in Database. That we will keep on discussing in further chapters.


For now, we will just look at the problems that we have created while creating `Users` table in day_06.

What problems do you see? I see at least two problems.

### Problem 1

### Problem 2

### Problem 3
